# Question 1

**Refer to Problem 6.42 which deals with lung capacity of rats exposed to ozone. Note: For consistency, please calculate the differences as After ‚Äì Before where needed.**

**A. Calculate the mean and standard deviation for Before and After (separately).**
```{r}

```

**B. Are the differences (After ‚Äì Before for each rat) normally distributed? Support your answer by including a qqplot of differences in your assignment.**
```{r}

```

**C. Is there sufficient evidence to support the research hypothesis that there is a difference in average lung capacity after ozone exposure? Use the paired t-test with Œ±=0.05. Give the hypotheses, test statistic, p-value and conclusion. (4 pts)**
```{r}

```

**D. Rerun the test from the previous question using the Wilcoxon Paired (Signed Rank) test. Give your p-value and conclusion. Use the wilcoxsign_test() function from the coin package with distribution = ‚Äúexact‚Äù.**
```{r}

```

# Question 2

**Refer to problem 7.9 which deals with rebound coefficients of baseballs. The summary statistics are provided here for your convenience: n = 40, ùë¶ÃÖ = 84.798, s = 2.684. The raw data is also available from the Ott & Longnecker companion site as ‚Äúexp07-9.txt‚Äù. Note that Table 7 (chisquare) does not have information for df = 39, so use the qchisq() R function to calculate table values needed for parts C and D.**

**A. Construct a boxplot of the data and include it in your assignment.**
```{r}

```

**B. Using ÔÅ°=0.01, test H0: ¬µ ‚â• 85 vs HA: ¬µ < 85. Give the one-sided p-value and conclusion.**
```{r}

```

**C. Construct a 99% CI for œÉ. Note: provide a standard ‚Äútwo-sided‚Äù CI here.**
```{r}

```

**D. Using ÔÅ°=0.01, test H0: œÉ ‚â§ 2 vs HA: œÉ > 2. Give your test statistic, rejection rule and conclusion. (4 pts)**
```{r}

```
