# Aim 1

**note: this sample size is required because I'm comparing placenta and amniotic fluid - if I'm looking at fetal lungs etc. I would technically only need 1 pregnant mouse per group, because the average litter size is 6-8**

Two-sample power analysis
H0: mu(aerosol) = mu(non-aerosol)
HA: mu(aerosol) = mu(non-aerosol)

n = ?
delta = 5 (conjectured uA-u0)
sd = 2 (conjectured sd)
sig.level = 0.05
power = 0.8?
alternative = two.sided
```{r}
power.t.test(power = 0.9, delta = 5, sd = 2, sig.level = 0.05, alternative = "two.sided", type = "two.sample")
```
