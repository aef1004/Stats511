# Statistical Analysis for Researchers

This repo contains all of the R-homework that I completed for STAT511 - Design and Data Analysis for Researchers: R Software.

## Topics covered in the class

### 1. Terminology and collecting data (Chapters 1-2)
### 2. Data description and probability distributions (Chapters 3-4)
### 3. Inferences about population central values (Chapter 5)
### 4. Comparing two population central values (Chapter 6)

 - Two-sample t-test and confidence intervals (equal variances)
 - Welch-Satterthwaite t-test and confidence intervals (unequal variances)
 - Sample size and power for two-sample t test
 - Wilcoxon Rank-sum (Two-sample) test
 - Paired samples: t-test and confidence interval
 - Wilcoxon Signed Rank (Paired sample) test
 - Bootstrap two-sample t confidence interval

### 5. Inferences about population variances (Chapter 7)

 - Studying standard deviation for a single population
